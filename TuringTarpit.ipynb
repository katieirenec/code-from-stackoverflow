What is an <em>iterable</em>? It\\'s anything like a <code>list</code> or <code>set</code> or <code>range</code> or dict-view, with a <em>built-in protocol for visiting each element in a certain order</em>.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In a nutshell: Most commonly, <strong>a generator is a lazy, incrementally-pending list</strong>, and <strong><code>yield</code> statements allow you to use function notation to program the list values</strong> the generator should incrementally spit out. <strong>Furthermore, advanced usage lets you use generators as coroutines (see below).</strong></p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>generator = myYieldingFunction(...)  # basically a list (but lazy)\\nx = list(generator)  # evaluate every element into a list\\n\\n   generator\\n       v\\n[x[0], ..., ???]\\n\\n         generator\\n             v\\n[x[0], x[1], ..., ???]\\n\\n               generator\\n                   v\\n[x[0], x[1], x[2], ..., ???]\\n\\n                       StopIteration exception\\n[x[0], x[1], x[2]]     done\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Basically, whenever the <code>yield</code> statement is encountered, the function pauses and saves its state, then emits &quot;the next return value in the \\'list\\'&quot; according to the python iterator protocol (to some syntactic construct like a for-loop that repeatedly calls <code>next()</code> and catches a <code>StopIteration</code> exception, etc.). You might have encountered generators with <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">generator expressions</a>; generator functions are more powerful because you can pass arguments back into the paused generator function, using them to implement coroutines. More on that later.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Basic Example (\\'list\\')</h2>\\n<p>Let\\'s define a function <code>makeRange</code> that\\'s just like Python\\'s <code>range</code>. Calling <code>makeRange(n)</code> RETURNS A GENERATOR:</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>def makeRange(n):\\n    # return 0,1,2,...,n-1\\n    i = 0\\n    while i &lt; n:\\n        yield i\\n        i += 1\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; makeRange(5)\\n&lt;generator object makeRange at 0x19e4aa0&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>To force the generator to immediately return its pending values, you can pass it into <code>list()</code> (just like you could any iterable):</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(makeRange(5))\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n</code></pre>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Comparing example to &quot;just returning a list&quot;</h2>\\n<p>The above example can be thought of as merely creating a list which you append to and return:</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code># return a list                  #  # return a generator\\ndef makeRange(n):                #  def makeRange(n):\\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;return [0,1,2,...,n-1]&quot;&quot;&quot; #      &quot;&quot;&quot;return 0,1,2,...,n-1&quot;&quot;&quot;\\n    TO_RETURN = []               # \\n    i = 0                        #      i = 0\\n    while i &lt; n:                 #      while i &lt; n:\\n        TO_RETURN += [i]         #          yield i\\n        i += 1                   #          i += 1\\n    return TO_RETURN             # \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; makeRange(5)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>There is one major difference, though; see the last section.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>How you might use generators</h2>\\n<p>An iterable is the last part of a list comprehension, and all generators are iterable, so they\\'re often used like so:</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>#                  &lt; ITERABLE &gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [x+10 for x in makeRange(5)]\\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>To get a better feel for generators, you can play around with the <code>itertools</code> module (be sure to use <code>chain.from_iterable</code> rather than <code>chain</code> when warranted). For example, you might even use generators to implement infinitely-long lazy lists like <code>itertools.count()</code>. You could implement your own <code>def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable)</code>, or alternatively do so with the <code>yield</code> keyword in a while-loop.</p>\\n<p>Please note: generators can actually be used for many more things, such as <a href=\"http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">implementing coroutines</a> or non-deterministic programming or other elegant things. However, the &quot;lazy lists&quot; viewpoint I present here is the most common use you will find.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>\\n<p>This is how the &quot;Python iteration protocol&quot; works. That is, what is going on when you do <code>list(makeRange(5))</code>. This is what I describe earlier as a &quot;lazy, incremental list&quot;.</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x=iter(range(5))\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)  # calls x.__next__(); x.next() is deprecated\\n0\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)\\n1\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)\\n2\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)\\n3\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)\\n4\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; next(x)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\nStopIteration\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The built-in function <code>next()</code> just calls the objects <code>.__next__()</code> function, which is a part of the &quot;iteration protocol&quot; and is found on all iterators. You can manually use the <code>next()</code> function (and other parts of the iteration protocol) to implement fancy things, usually at the expense of readability, so try to avoid doing that...</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Coroutines</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Coroutine</a> example:</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>def interactiveProcedure():\\n    userResponse = yield makeQuestionWebpage()\\n    print(\\'user response:\\', userResponse)\\n    yield \\'success\\'\\n\\ncoroutine = interactiveProcedure()\\nwebFormData = next(coroutine)  # same as .send(None)\\nuserResponse = serveWebForm(webFormData)\\n\\n# ...at some point later on web form submit...\\n\\nsuccessStatus = coroutine.send(userResponse)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>A coroutine (generators which generally accept input via the <code>yield</code> keyword e.g. <code>nextInput = yield nextOutput</code>, as a form of two-way communication) is basically a computation which is allowed to pause itself and request input (e.g. to what it should do next). When the coroutine pauses itself (when the running coroutine eventually hits a <code>yield</code> keyword), the computation is paused and control is inverted (yielded) back to the \\'calling\\' function (the frame which requested the <code>next</code> value of the computation). The paused generator/coroutine remains paused until another invoking function (possibly a different function/context) requests the next value to unpause it (usually passing input data to direct the paused logic interior to the coroutine\\'s code).</p>\\n<p><strong>You can think of python coroutines as lazy incrementally-pending lists, where the next element doesn\\'t just depend on the previous computation, but also on input you may opt to inject during the generation process.</strong></p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Minutiae</h2>\\n<p>Normally, most people would not care about the following distinctions and probably want to stop reading here.</p>\\n<p>In Python-speak, an <em>iterable</em> is any object which &quot;understands the concept of a for-loop&quot; like a list <code>[1,2,3]</code>, and an <em>iterator</em> is a specific instance of the requested for-loop like <code>[1,2,3].__iter__()</code>. A <em>generator</em> is exactly the same as any iterator, except for the way it was written (with function syntax).</p>\\n<p>When you request an iterator from a list, it creates a new iterator. However, when you request an iterator from an iterator (which you would rarely do), it just gives you a copy of itself.</p>\\n<p>Thus, in the unlikely event that you are failing to do something like this...</p>\\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>&gt; x = myRange(5)\\n&gt; list(x)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n&gt; list(x)\\n[]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>... then remember that a generator is an <em>iterator</em>; that is, it is one-time-use. If you want to reuse it, you should call <code>myRange(...)</code> again. If you need to use the result twice, convert the result to a list and store it in a variable <code>x = list(myRange(5))</code>. Those who absolutely need to clone a generator (for example, who are doing terrifyingly hackish metaprogramming) can use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>itertools.tee</code></a> (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee\" rel=\"noreferrer\">still works in Python 3</a>) if absolutely necessary, since the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0323/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal</a> has been deferred.</p>\\n'},\n",

              "   'body': '<p>There is one type of answer that I don\\'t feel has been given yet, among the many great answers that describe how to use generators. Here is the programming language theory answer:</p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>yield</code> statement in Python returns a generator. A generator in Python is a function that returns <i>continuations</i> (and specifically a type of coroutine, but continuations represent the more general mechanism to understand what is going on).</p>\\n\\n<p>Continuations in programming languages theory are a much more fundamental kind of computation, but they are not often used, because they are extremely hard to reason about and also very difficult to implement. But the idea of what a continuation is, is straightforward: it is the state of a computation that has not yet finished. In this state, the current values of variables, the operations that have yet to be performed, and so on, are saved. Then at some point later in the program the continuation can be invoked, such that the program\\'s variables are reset to that state and the operations that were saved are carried out.</p>\\n\\n<p>Continuations, in this more general form, can be implemented in two ways. In the <code>call/cc</code> way, the program\\'s stack is literally saved and then when the continuation is invoked, the stack is restored.</p>\\n\\n<p>In continuation passing style (CPS), continuations are just normal functions (only in languages where functions are first class) which the programmer explicitly manages and passes around to subroutines. In this style, program state is represented by closures (and the variables that happen to be encoded in them) rather than variables that reside somewhere on the stack. Functions that manage control flow accept continuation as arguments (in some variations of CPS, functions may accept multiple continuations) and manipulate control flow by invoking them by simply calling them and returning afterwards. A very simple example of continuation passing style is as follows:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def save_file(filename):\\n  def write_file_continuation():\\n    write_stuff_to_file(filename)\\n\\n  check_if_file_exists_and_user_wants_to_overwrite(write_file_continuation)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In this (very simplistic) example, the programmer saves the operation of actually writing the file into a continuation (which can potentially be a very complex operation with many details to write out), and then passes that continuation (i.e, as a first-class closure) to another operator which does some more processing, and then calls it if necessary. (I use this design pattern a lot in actual GUI programming, either because it saves me lines of code or, more importantly, to manage control flow after GUI events trigger.)</p>\\n\\n<p>The rest of this post will, without loss of generality, conceptualize continuations as CPS, because it is a hell of a lot easier to understand and read.</p>\\n\\n<p><br></p>\\n\\n<p>Now let\\'s talk about generators in Python. Generators are a specific subtype of continuation. Whereas <strong>continuations are able in general to save the state of a <em>computation</em></strong> (i.e., the program\\'s call stack), <strong>generators are only able to save the state of iteration over an <em>iterator</em></strong>. Although, this definition is slightly misleading for certain use cases of generators. For instance:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def f():\\n  while True:\\n    yield 4\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>This is clearly a reasonable iterable whose behavior is well defined -- each time the generator iterates over it, it returns 4 (and does so forever). But it isn\\'t probably the prototypical type of iterable that comes to mind when thinking of iterators (i.e., <code>for x in collection: do_something(x)</code>). This example illustrates the power of generators: if anything is an iterator, a generator can save the state of its iteration.</p>\\n\\n<p>To reiterate: Continuations can save the state of a program\\'s stack and generators can save the state of iteration. This means that continuations are more a lot powerful than generators, but also that generators are a lot, lot easier. They are easier for the language designer to implement, and they are easier for the programmer to use (if you have some time to burn, try to read and understand <a href=\"http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/callcc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page about continuations and call/cc</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>But you could easily implement (and conceptualize) generators as a simple, specific case of continuation passing style:</p>\\n\\n<p>Whenever <code>yield</code> is called, it tells the function to return a continuation.  When the function is called again, it starts from wherever it left off. So, in pseudo-pseudocode (i.e., not pseudocode, but not code) the generator\\'s <code>next</code> method is basically as follows:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class Generator():\\n  def __init__(self,iterable,generatorfun):\\n    self.next_continuation = lambda:generatorfun(iterable)\\n\\n  def next(self):\\n    value, next_continuation = self.next_continuation()\\n    self.next_continuation = next_continuation\\n    return value\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>where the <code>yield</code> keyword is actually syntactic sugar for the real generator function, basically something like:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def generatorfun(iterable):\\n  if len(iterable) == 0:\\n    raise StopIteration\\n  else:\\n    return (iterable[0], lambda:generatorfun(iterable[1:]))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Remember that this is just pseudocode and the actual implementation of generators in Python is more complex. But as an exercise to understand what is going on, try to use continuation passing style to implement generator objects without use of the <code>yield</code> keyword.</p>\\n'},\n",

And before you can understand generators, you must understand <em>iterables</em>.</p>\\n<h2>Iterables</h2>\\n<p>When you create a list, you can read its items one by one. Reading its items one by one is called iteration:</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [1, 2, 3]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><code>mylist</code> is an <em>iterable</em>. When you use a list comprehension, you create a list, and so an iterable:</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Everything you can use &quot;<code>for... in...</code>&quot; on is an iterable; <code>lists</code>, <code>strings</code>, files...</p>\\n<p>These iterables are handy because you can read them as much as you wish, but you store all the values in memory and this is not always what you want when you have a lot of values.</p>\\n<h2>Generators</h2>\\n<p>Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable <strong>you can only iterate over once</strong>. Generators do not store all the values in memory, <strong>they generate the values on the fly</strong>:</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mygenerator:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>It is just the same except you used <code>()</code> instead of <code>[]</code>. BUT, you <strong>cannot</strong> perform <code>for i in mygenerator</code> a second time since generators can only be used once: they calculate 0, then forget about it and calculate 1, and end calculating 4, one by one.</p>\\n<h2>Yield</h2>\\n<p><code>yield</code> is a keyword that is used like <code>return</code>, except the function will return a generator.</p>\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def create_generator():\\n...    mylist = range(3)\\n...    for i in mylist:\\n...        yield i*i\\n...\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mygenerator = create_generator() # create a generator\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mygenerator) # mygenerator is an object!\\n&lt;generator object create_generator at 0xb7555c34&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mygenerator:\\n...     print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here it\\'s a useless example, but it\\'s handy when you know your function will return a huge set of values that you will only need to read once.</p>\\n<p>To master <code>yield</code>, you must understand that <strong>when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run.</strong> The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky.</p>\\n<p>Then, your code will continue from where it left off each time <code>for</code> uses the generator.</p>\\n<p>Now the hard part:</p>\\n<p>The first time the <code>for</code> calls the generator object created from your function, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits <code>yield</code>, then it\\'ll return the first value of the loop. Then, each subsequent call will run another iteration of the loop you have written in the function and return the next value. This will continue until the generator is considered empty, which happens when the function runs without hitting <code>yield</code>. That can be because the loop has come to an end, or because you no longer satisfy an <code>&quot;if/else&quot;</code>.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Your code explained</h2>\\n<p><em>Generator:</em></p>\\n<pre><code># Here you create the method of the node object that will return the generator\\ndef _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):\\n\\n    # Here is the code that will be called each time you use the generator object:\\n\\n    # If there is still a child of the node object on its left\\n    # AND if the distance is ok, return the next child\\n    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist &lt; self._median:\\n        yield self._leftchild\\n\\n    # If there is still a child of the node object on its right\\n    # AND if the distance is ok, return the next child\\n    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist &gt;= self._median:\\n        yield self._rightchild\\n\\n    # If the function arrives here, the generator will be considered empty\\n    # there are no more than two values: the left and the right children\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Caller:</em></p>\\n<pre><code># Create an empty list and a list with the current object reference\\nresult, candidates = list(), [self]\\n\\n# Loop on candidates (they contain only one element at the beginning)\\nwhile candidates:\\n\\n    # Get the last candidate and remove it from the list\\n    node = candidates.pop()\\n\\n    # Get the distance between obj and the candidate\\n    distance = node._get_dist(obj)\\n\\n    # If the distance is ok, then you can fill in the result\\n    if distance &lt;= max_dist and distance &gt;= min_dist:\\n        result.extend(node._values)\\n\\n    # Add the children of the candidate to the candidate\\'s list\\n    # so the loop will keep running until it has looked\\n    # at all the children of the children of the children, etc. of the candidate\\n    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))\\n\\nreturn result\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This code contains several smart parts:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>The loop iterates on a list, but the list expands while the loop is being iterated.

Python expects iterables so it will work with strings, lists, tuples, and generators! This is called duck typing and is one of the reasons why Python is so cool.

So, I do the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>I call you and tell you that I want a sequence of numbers which are calculated in a specific way, and I let you know what the algorithm is. <br/>\\n<b>This step corresponds to <code>def</code>ining the generator function, i.e. the function containing a <code>yield</code>.</b></li>\\n<li>Sometime later, I tell you, &quot;OK, get ready to tell me the sequence of numbers&quot;. <br/>\\n<b>This step corresponds to calling the generator function which returns a generator object.</b> Note that you don\\'t tell me any numbers yet; you just grab your paper and pencil.</li>\\n<li>I ask you, &quot;tell me the next number&quot;, and you tell me the first number; after that, you wait for me to ask you for the next number. It\\'s your job to remember where you were, what numbers you have already said, and what is the next number. I don\\'t care about the details. <br/>\\n<b>This step corresponds to calling <code>next(generator)</code> on the generator object.</b><br />\\n(In Python 2, <code>.next</code> was a method of the generator object; in Python 3, it is named <code>.__next__</code>, but the proper way to call it is using the builtin <code>next()</code> function just like <code>len()</code> and <code>.__len__</code>)</li>\\n<li>… repeat previous step, until…</li>\\n<li>eventually, you might come to an end.

The return value from <code>next()</code> is assigned to <code>x</code> and the loop body is executed. If an exception <code>StopIteration</code> is raised from within <code>next()</code>, it means there are no more values in the iterator and the loop is exited.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The truth is Python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to <em>loop over</em> the contents of an object - so it could be a for loop, but it could also be code like <code>otherlist.extend(mylist)</code> (where <code>otherlist</code> is a Python list).</p>\\n<p>Here <code>mylist</code> is an <em>iterable</em> because it implements the iterator protocol. In a user-defined class, you can implement the <code>__iter__()</code> method to make instances of your class iterable. This method should return an <em>iterator</em>. An iterator is an object with a <code>next()</code> method. It is possible to implement both <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>next()</code> on the same class, and have <code>__iter__()</code> return <code>self</code>. This will work for simple cases, but not when you want two iterators looping over the same object at the same time.</p>\\n<p>So that's the iterator protocol, many objects implement this protocol:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Built-in lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and files.</li>\\n<li>User-defined classes that implement <code>__iter__()</code>.</li>\\n<li>Generators.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Note that a <code>for</code> loop doesn't know what kind of object it's dealing with - it just follows the iterator protocol, and is happy to get item after item as it calls <code>next()</code>. Built-in lists return their items one by one, dictionaries return the <em>keys</em> one by one, files return the <em>lines</em> one by one, etc. And generators return... well that's where <code>yield</code> comes in:</p>\\n<pre><code>def f123():\\n    yield 1\\n    yield 2\\n    yield 3\\n\\nfor item in f123():\\n    print item\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Instead of <code>yield</code> statements, if you had three <code>return</code> statements in <code>f123()</code> only the first would get executed, and the function would exit. But <code>f123()</code> is no ordinary function. When <code>f123()</code> is called, it <em>does not</em> return any of the values in the yield statements! It returns a generator object. Also, the function does not really exit - it goes into a suspended state. When the <code>for</code> loop tries to loop over the generator object, the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the <code>yield</code> it previously returned from, executes the next line of code, in this case, a <code>yield</code> statement, and returns that as the next item. This happens until the function exits, at which point the generator raises <code>StopIteration</code>, and the loop exits.</p>\\n<p>So the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol, by exposing <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>next()</code> methods to keep the <code>for</code> loop happy. At the other end, however, it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it, and puts it back in suspended mode.</p>\\n<h2>Why Use Generators?</h2>\\n<p>Usually, you can write code that doesn't use generators but implements the same logic. One option is to use the temporary list 'trick' I mentioned before. That will not work in all cases, for e.g. if you have infinite loops, or it may make inefficient use of memory when you have a really long list. The other approach is to implement a new iterable class SomethingIter that keeps the state in instance members and performs the next logical step in its <code>next()</code> (or <code>__next__()</code> in Python 3) method. Depending on the logic, the code inside the <code>next()</code> method may end up looking very complex and prone to bugs. Here generators provide a clean and easy solution.</p>\\n\"},\n",

See my references above, but in summary: an <strong>iterable</strong> has an <code>__iter__</code> method returning an <strong>iterator</strong>. An <strong>iterator</strong> additionally provides a <code>.__next__</code> method, which is implicitly called by <code>for</code> loops until it raises <code>StopIteration</code>, and once it does raise <code>StopIteration</code>, it will continue to do so.</li>\\n<li>It then uses a generator expression to describe what a generator is. Since a generator expression is simply a convenient way to create an <strong>iterator</strong>, it only confuses the matter, and we still have not yet gotten to the <code>yield</code> part.</li>\\n<li>In <strong>Controlling a generator exhaustion</strong> he calls the <code>.next</code> method (which only works in Python 2), when instead he should use the builtin function, <code>next</code>. Calling <code>next(obj)</code> would be an appropriate layer of indirection, because his code does not work in Python 3.</li>\\n<li>Itertools?

That function will return an object of <code>generator</code> type. <strong>The <code>yield</code> keyword is a flag to notify the python compiler to treat such function specially.</strong> Normal functions will terminate once some value is returned from it. But with the help of the compiler, the generator function <strong>can be thought of</strong> as resumable. That is, the execution context will be restored and the execution will continue from last run. Until you explicitly call return, which will raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception (which is also part of the iterator protocol), or reach the end of the function. I found a lot of references about <code>generator</code> but this <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/functional.html#generators\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one</a> from the <code>functional programming perspective</code> is the most digestable.</p>\\n\\n<p>(Now I want to talk about the rationale behind <code>generator</code>, and the <code>iterator</code> based on my own understanding. I hope this can help you grasp the <strong><em>essential motivation</em></strong> of iterator and generator. Such concept shows up in other languages as well such as C#.)</p>\\n\\n<p>As I understand, when we want to process a bunch of data, we usually first store the data somewhere and then process it one by one. But this <em>naive</em> approach is problematic. If the data volume is huge, it\\'s expensive to store them as a whole beforehand. <strong>So instead of storing the <code>data</code> itself directly, why not store some kind of <code>metadata</code> indirectly, i.e. <code>the logic how the data is computed</code></strong>. </p>\\n\\n<p>There are 2 approaches to wrap such metadata.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>The OO approach, we wrap the metadata <code>as a class</code>. This is the so-called <code>iterator</code> who implements the iterator protocol (i.e. the <code>__next__()</code>, and <code>__iter__()</code> methods). This is also the commonly seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern#Python\" rel=\"noreferrer\">iterator design pattern</a>.</li>\\n<li>The functional approach, we wrap the metadata <code>as a function</code>. This is\\nthe so-called <code>generator function</code>. But under the hood, the returned <code>generator object</code> still <code>IS-A</code> iterator because it also implements the iterator protocol.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Either way, an iterator is created, i.e. some object that can give you the data you want. The OO approach may be a bit complex. Anyway, which one to use is up to you.</p>\\n'},\n",

When the <code>generator</code> is iterated, it executes your function  until it reaches the next <code>yield</code> then suspends execution and evaluates to the value passed to <code>yield</code>. It repeats this process on each iteration until the path of execution exits the function.

So the execution would look like this:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>root element is first; check if it has left childs and <code>for</code> iterate them (let's call it it1 because its the first iterator object)</li>\\n<li>it has a child so the <code>for</code> is executed. The <code>for child in self.left</code> creates a <strong>new iterator</strong> from <code>self.left</code>, which is a Node object itself (it2)</li>\\n<li>Same logic as 2, and a new <code>iterator</code> is created (it3)</li>\\n<li>Now we reached the left end of the tree. <code>it3</code> has no left childs so it continues and <code>yield self.value</code></li>\\n<li>On the next call to <code>next(it3)</code> it raises <code>StopIteration</code> and exists since it has no right childs (it reaches to the end of the function without yield anything)</li>\\n<li><code>it1</code> and <code>it2</code> are still active - they are not exhausted and calling <code>next(it2)</code> would yield values, not raise <code>StopIteration</code></li>\\n<li>Now we are back to <code>it2</code> context, and call <code>next(it2)</code> which continues where it stopped: right after the <code>yield child</code> statement.

However, there is a slight difference. The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield, instead of simply returning a value.</p>\\n<p>Inside a program, when you call a function that has a yield statement, as soon as a yield is encountered, the execution of the function stops and returns an object of the generator to the function caller. In simpler words, the yield keyword will convert an expression that is specified along with it to a generator object and return it to the caller. Hence, if you want to get the values stored inside the generator object, you need to iterate over it.</p>\\n<p>It will not destroy the local variables’ states. Whenever a function is called, the execution will start from the last yield expression. Please note that a function that contains a yield keyword is known as a generator function.</p>\\n<p>When you use a function with a return value, every time you call the function, it starts with a new set of variables. In contrast, if you use a generator function instead of a normal function, the execution will start right from where it left last.</p>\\n<p>If you want to return multiple values from a function, you can use generator functions with yield keywords. The yield expressions return multiple values. They return one value, then wait, save the local state, and resume again.</p>\\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/yield-in-python\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/yield-in-python</a></p>\\n'},\n",

The <em>iterables</em> are things you can loop over.

Then, each subsequent call will run the next iteration of the loop you wrote in the function and return the next value. This will continue until the generator is considered empty, which yields when there is no hit while the function is running. That may be because the loop has ended, or because you are no longer satisfied with &quot;if/else&quot;.</p>\\n<p>Personal understanding I hope to help you!</p>\\n'},\n",

So if result is the generator then you could do something like y = result.next(555), and the program yielding values could say something like z = yield 999. The value of y would be 999 that next gets from the yield, and the value of z would be 555 that yield gets from the next. Python get and send methods have a similar effect.</p>\\n\"},\n",

If this is a problem, you could instead use JavaScript to do this recursively for an element\\'s descendants:\\nfunction makeUnselectable(node) {\\n    if (node.nodeType == 1) {\\n        node.setAttribute(\"unselectable\", \"on\");\\n    }\\n    var child = node.firstChild;\\n    while (child) {\\n        makeUnselectable(child);\\n        child = child.nextSibling;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nmakeUnselectable(document.getElementById(\"foo\"));\\n\\n\\nUpdate 30 April 2014: This tree traversal needs to be rerun whenever a new element is added to the tree, but it seems from a comment by @Han that it is possible to avoid this by adding a mousedown event handler that sets unselectable on the target of the event. See http://jsbin.com/yagekiji/1 for details.\\n\\nThis still doesn\\'t cover all possibilities. While it is impossible to initiate selections in unselectable elements, in some browsers (Internet\\xa0Explorer and Firefox, for example) it\\'s still impossible to prevent selections that start before and end after the unselectable element without making the whole document unselectable.\\n',\n",
